Sorry But need to post this joke.

```javascript

//How impress girls by coding...? Tell me guys..

//If you send a girl a div with a pink box-shadow and just a paragraph in it and say it was for her, she wouldn't be that amazed. 
//Try making something that not only would amaze her, but anyone who would be looking at it. Make it as unique as you usually would, there's no need that you need to //simplify it or change it because she's a girl. üêè
